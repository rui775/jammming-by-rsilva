# Jammming

This application was made as part of the full stack engineer course at [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).

This is a second version where I implemented a Spotify web API.

Its purpose is to search for songs and add them to a playlist which can then be saved in your playlist account (you should have a registered Spotify account, free or paid).

Enjoy!
